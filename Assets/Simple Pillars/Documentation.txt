These pillars should be placed like any other 3D model.

Most work well when used with third party tiling materials.  The 
round columns (under pieces) have been made UVs place so that a tiling 
material will wrap around exactly once; thick three high (3h) pieces 
will do so without distortion as the diameter and radius are the 
same, and the alternate four high pillars (4h alt) will do the 
same by wrapping the top quarter of the column to the lower third 
of the textures.  Thinner pieces will slighly distor textures, while 
pillar 03 will have more distortion.  Caps, one-mesh who pillars, 
and pillar 03 work best with low detail, high-noise materials like 
stone.

Most pillars are very low poly, many under 100 triangles, most middle 
pieces are under 300 and all middle pieces and under 1k.  The caps are 
similarly low poly, as are the single mesh capped pillars.

These are mostly for those looking to add some non-square / round 
pillars to a low poly or stylized environment.
